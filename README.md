# CSS Animation Blocks
_This JavaScript library has two main purposes_

1. **Animation blocks:** _Simplify the creation of browser animations by breaking the main timeline into small, named blocks (ex. intro, title-sequence, credits) and calling those blocks from the main timeline (at time in minutes:seconds.frames)._

2. _**CSS Animation:** Easing collaboration between web designers and frontend developers by using CSS animation, thus allowing anyone to create/edit individual motion sequences in stylesheets without altering JavaScript code._
